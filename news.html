Our annual Club Championships took place on Wednesday 3rd June during our usual class times. We divided the students into 3 sections and the standard of Taekwon-Do across all the sections was excellent. All divisions from our youngest Taekwon-Do kids right up to our senior students performed to the best of their abilities in an effort to impress our judge on the night Ms Frances O’Neill and win one of the many trophies on display. A big thank you as always goes out to our parents, grandparents and friends who packed the hall to capacity to lend support to all the students. Congratulations to everybody on a tremendous evening of Taekwon-Do.

                    the 5th November. A vigorous warm up in all classes followed by forward/backward rolls, flips,
                    breakfalls, tumbles, self-defence, sparring , speed and reaction drills. Everybody put in a great
                    effort
                    and worked up a healthy sweat! In the senior class we also worked on sparring combinations
                    concentrating
                    on coordination, correct distance and counter attacks with a variety of offensive and defensive
                    moves.
                    Ms Marsikova captivated all those present with her own agility and variety of self-defence
                    techniques.
                    The classes were a hugh success with a great atmosphere throughout and we are already looking
